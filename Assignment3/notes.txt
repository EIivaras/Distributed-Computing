Step 1: Set up ZooKeeper
- You can access it on manta.uwaterloo.ca on the default TCP port (2181)
- If you want to set up your own instance, look at slides for info

Step 2: Create a parent znode
- ZooKeeper node must be created manually before you can run A3 code
- Create your znode using the provided script: ./createznode.sh
    --> You only need to do this ONCE for the assignment, and DO NOT HARDCODE THE ZNODE NAME

Step 3: Study the client code
--> Really understand what it is doing
- The client determines the primary replica by listing the chidlren of the designation znode, as created in step 2
- The client sorts the returned list of children in ascending lexicographical order and identifies the smallest child as the znode denoting the primary replica
    - The client then parses the data from this node to extract the hostname and port number to the primary and sets a watch
- If the primary fails, the client receives a notification and executes the above procedure again to determine the new primary

Step 4: Write the server bootstrap code
- On startup, each server process must contact ZooKeeper and create a child node uner a parent znode specified on the command linearizable
    - This parent znode must be the same as the one queried by the client to determine the address of the primary
- The newly created child znode must have both the EPHEMERAL and SEQUENCE flags set
    - Furthermore, child znode must store, as its data payload, a host:port string denoting the address of the server process
- The server whose child znode has the smallest name in the lexicographic order is the primary
    - The other one (if it exists) is the secondary or backup

Step 5: Add Replication

- To implement replication, it is critical that each server process knows whether it is the primary or backup 
    - This can be done by querying ZooKeeper similarly to the client code
- The primary server process must implement concurrency control above and beyond the synchronization provided internally by the ConcurrentHashMap (or another Java data structure)
    - In the system we have two copies of the data (one on the primary, one on the backup), and a ConcurrentHashMap would only hold ONE of these copies (and the synchronization for the map is only for that one map)
        - Only using the baked-in sychronization will NOT be enough to make the system linearizable as we have 2
    - If in doubt, use a Java "lock" for concurrency control -- DO NOT USE ZOOKEEPER LOCKS, THEY ARE VERY SLOW.
- Additionally, DO NOT STORE ALL THE KEY-VALUE PAIRS IN ZOOKEEPER
    - ZooKeeper is only used for failure detection and primary determination, it should not be used for concurrency control or storage of your main dataset

Step 6 - Implement Recovery From Failure:

- If primary server process crashes, backup server process must detect AUTOMATICALLY that the ephermal znode created by the primary is gone
- At this point, backup must become the new primary and begin accepting "get" and "put" requests from clients
    - The provided client code with automatically re-direct connections to the new primary after some time
        --> I believe since the client determines who the primary is, they'll set some internal variable that the nodes will have to check in order to determine if they are the primary
            --> Step 5 says this can be done by querying ZooKeeper similar to how the client does
- The new primary may execute without a backup for some period of time immediately after a crash failure until a backup is started
- When the new backup is started (either manually during testing or via the grading script), it MUST COPY ALL KEY-VALUE PAIRS OVER FROM THE NEW PRIMARY TO AVOID DATA LOSS in the event that the new primary fails as well

Step 7: Test Thoroughly
- To test your code, run an experiment similar to the following:
    1. Ensure that ZooKeeper is running and create the parent znode
        --> ONE TIME THING FOR THE WHOLE ASSIGNMENT, AS DONE IN STEP 2
    2. Start primary and backup server processes
        - Which one is which is decided at runtime, so you're simply starting 2 processes of the server executing the same code
        - They will talk to ZooKeeper to decide who is the primary and the backup
            - You do not decide the roles, the processes decide on their own
    3. Launch the provided client and begin executing a long workload
        - Somewhere between 10 seconds and 1 minute
    4. Wait two or more seconds, and kill the primary OR the backup
    5. Wait two or more seconds, and start a new backup server
    6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for several iterations
- If you get no exceptions (aside from one mentioned below) and linearizability checker tells you your execution was linearizable, repeat the exercise
    - Change client settings, use more/fewer threads (experiment with different levels of concurrency) and convince yourself that your implementation is correct
- The key-value service should continue to process get and put requests after each failure, including b/w steps 4 and 5 when the new primary is running temporarily without a backup
- The client may throw exceptions in step 4, but there should be NO LINEARIZABILITY VIOLATIONS
    - Client will automatically try and re-establish a connection to the new primary
        - Programmed to do that, nothing you need to do OTHER THAN CORRECTLY CONFIGURE THE STATE IN ZOOKEEPER
- THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT ASSIGNMENT, TEST THOROUGHLY

Packaging and Submission:
- You may use multiple Java files but do not change the name of the client (A3Client) or the server (StorageNode) programs, or their command line arugments
- Do NOT change the implementation of the client AT ALL
- You must modify the server code to complete its implementation
- You may add new procedures to a3.thrift, but do NOT add services

Grading Scheme:
- 60% correctness, 40% performance
- Penalties apply in the following cases:
    - Solution uses oneway RPCs for replication
        - DO NOT USE ONE WAY RPCs (it assumes network is reliable)
    - Solution cannot be compile or throws an exception during testing despite receiving valid input
    - Solution produces incorrect outputs (i.e. non-linearizable)
        - Heavy penalties
    - Solution is improperly packaged/you submitted starter code instead of Solution

Hints and Tips:
- Testing by graders will be done with 1-2 server processes at a time
    - This means ONE PRIMARY and AT MOST ONE BACKUP REPLICA
- Throughput of more than 25000 ops/s is achieveable on ecelinux hosts with 8 client threads
    - To achieve this, will need efficient concurrency control
- Test with both small data sets (ex/ key-value pairs) and larger data sets (ex/ 1M key-value pairs)
    - Small data sets = more contention, larger data sets = less contention, effects not only amount of data stored but behaviour of concurrency contorl mechanism
- ! IMPORTANT ! SPREAD YOUR PROCESSES AMONG MULTIPLE ECELINUX HOSTS
    - Do NOT run everything on one machine!
        - Your network will be a little faster than it should be -- you will either run out of threads or get overly optimistic results
- Be prepared to handle frequent failures (one every 2 seconds), even w/ 1M key-value pairs
    - Could fail the primary or the backup each time, decided by grading script
- ! IMPORTANT ! Failures will be simulated on linux using "kill -9", NOT using "Ctrl + C"
- Be prepared to handle port reuse
    - If primary fails and is restarted as backup on same host w/ same RPC port, should still work
        - Tweak your socket settings if you need to in order to make sure you can reuse the same ports even after a process is killed using "kill -9"
