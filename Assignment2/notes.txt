It's possible that the last user could have NOT rated a movie, so in that case you'll be left with a trailing comma - make sure you can parse this!

Task 1: 
-For each movie, output the column numbers of the of users who gave the highest ratings
-If the highest rating is given by multiple users, output all of them in ascending numerical order
-Assume that there is at least one non-blank rating for each movie

Task 2:
-Compute the total number of (non-blank) ratings
-Output the total as a SINGLE NUMBER on a SINGLE LINE

Task 3:
-For each user, output the user's column number and the total number of ratings for that user
-If a user has no ratings, then output 0 for that users
Ex/ 1,2 // user 1 has 2 ratings

Task 4:
-For each pair of movies, compute the number of users who assigned the same (non-blank) rating to both movies
-You will have a "similarity" score that will be equal to the # of users who rated a pair of movies the same value
-The output will be of the form:
Ex/ Movie Title 1, Movie Title 2, Similarity Score
-For each pair of movies, you will output them in increasing lexicographic order
Ex/ "Apocalypto" before "Apollo 13" for movie title 1 and 2 order
    --> For this reason we will be eliminating duplicates (no Apollo 13 -> Apocalypto)
-Produce output even if the similarity is 0

For Task 4, you should follow an approach similar to a map-side join (look it up).
--> Use the Hadoop distributed cache and Spark broadcast variables.
-->> In Java, you throw your input dataset into the distributed cache and share that with all your map tasks
-->> In Spark, you place the dataset in the broadcast variable and share that with all the partitions
-->>> We assume the input is small enough that you can fully replicate it to all the workers.
-->>>> In this particular case, that gives you the best performance

The programs we will write will receive two command line arguments: an INPUT FILE and an OUTPUT PATH
    --> Output PATH b/c hadoop and spark each create multiple output files
The input file and output path should be configurable via the command line arguments.
Make sure you use the generic options parser in Hadoop and the right technique in spark to parse the command line arguments.
    --> The command line used to run your program may have many more arguments then those used to run your program.

A Hadoop program generates output by emitting tuples in the reducer.
If the last job in your workflow does not have a reducer, then the program generates output by emitting tuples in the mapper.
A Spark program generates human-readable output by executing the saveAsTextFile method on an RDD.
** You should not be opening and writing output files using any other means.
The input and output files must use comma-delimited records. DO NOT USE TABS OR SPACES.
    --> Overwrite the default settings in Hadoop and Spark to get the correct behaviour.
The order of records in the input and output files does not matter.
    --> To compare your outputs w/ the sample outputs given in the starter code tarball, first coalesce and sort the output files, and then compare using the diff utility.
    Ex/ cat outputA/* | sort > normalized_outputA.txt
        cat outputB/* | sort > normalized_outputB.txt
        diff normalized_outputA.txt normalize_outputB.txt
    --> Sort fixes the order to compare
    --> COMPARE RESULTS BETWEEN YOUR HADOOP AND SPARK PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THEY MATCH

DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER FILES THAN THE ONES ALREADY THERE.
DO NOT RENAME THE OBJECTS/FILES.

Each program will take as arguments the input file and output path only.
If you require temporary output directories for your Hadoop workflows, take the output path and
append a suffix (ex/ given "myout", append "_tmp" to obtain "myout_tmp").
**This is only in the case where you need to run multiple Hadoop MR jobs back to back in order to solve a particular problem using the HMR framework.

//~~~~~~ PERFORMANCE ~~~~~~//
For performance, focus on:
--> Minimize the # of job stages
    --> In Hadoop MR, instead of doing 2 jobs back to back, use a single job if that is possible
    --> And btw, if you need to glue together 2 jobs, it's still 1 program, 1 mainline, but in that mainline you orchestrate job #1 and then job #2
--> The # of data shuffles
    --> If it's possible to do something with a mapper and without a reducer, do it that way cus you avoid a shuffle.
--> The amount of time spent in garbage collection

Performance will be assessed partly by measuring the running times of your programs, and partly by inspecting various performance counters.
Ex/ # of bytes read, written, shuffled, etc

STRESS MORE ABOUT CORRECTNESS THAN PERFORMANCE

//~~~~~~ CLUSTER HOUSE RULES ~~~~~~//
Storage space on the cluster is limited, so please key your HDFS usage below 1GB.
If you want to experiment with large inputs then consider placing them in HDFS under /tmp where they can be accessed by other students.
    --> This encourages sharing and avoids duplication.
Please limit yourself to running one Hadoop or Spark job at a time, especially during busy periods such as shortly before the deadline.
Do not let any job run for more than 30 minutes on the cluster -- kill it immeidately if it gets to that point.

//~~~~~~ NOTES ABOUT GETTING FILES ~~~~~~//
All hadoop files are stored on the hadoop distributed file system, which we do not have direct access to.
If you want to interact with hdfs, use "hdfs dfs [commands]".
To get output files, for example, you can use "hdfs dfs -get /user/zwalford/a2_starter_code_output_hadoop"

//~~~~~~ NOTES ON FINDING PERFORMANCE STATISTICS/PRINTOUTS FOR SPARK AND HADOOP ~~~~~~//
Stuff like the garbage collection time is listed when you complete the job, but you may want to come back to it later (such as after exiting the terminal).
You can use `yarn app -list -appStates ALL -appTypes [MAPREDUCE OR SPARK] | grep [your userid]` (without the square brackets) in order to get a list of your past jobs.
The entry with the HIGHEST application ID is the most recent. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MIX UP APPLICATION AND JOB ID!
To pull the logs for that application, you can use `yarn logs -applicationId [application ID you copied] > [file to redirect to].`
Then, just look at the file that you redireced the logs to for your output.
